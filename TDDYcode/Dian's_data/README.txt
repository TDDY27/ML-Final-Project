Write your code in `c3_read_*.py`


This TDDYcode and the dataset is from ChengDian 
which is implemented in different ipynb file (datatype corresponding to those in the ChengDiandataset directory)

and now, the most of the code is in the readraw.ipynb including SVM families begging SVM with different parameters
which still need to be rerun with new data which has different kinds of preprocessing
(I'm now going to send my data into my PC s.t. it can run much more faster in comparison to my lovely laptop)
