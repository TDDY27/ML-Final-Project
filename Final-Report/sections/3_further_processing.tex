\subsection*{Diff}

\quad For those attributes which both home team and the away team have, for example, "home-team-spread-mean". We calculate the difference of the two values, and use only one value to replace two. These features are considered to have a strong connection to the final score, which can directly affect the result.

\subsection*{Ratio}
\quad However, here are some attributes that are calculated index instead of statistics. We believe that the difference between 0.8 and 0.9 differs from that between 0.1 and 0.2. "home-batting-onbase-perc-10RA" is an example. According to Lanchester's laws in military science, we change the formula to:

Ratio$(a,b) = sign(c)\cdot\sqrt{|c|}$, where $c = a * |a| - b * |b|$.

It is the difference of the square of the value with some technique to deal with different sign of two input.
