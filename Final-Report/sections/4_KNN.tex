\subsection*{KNN}

\quad We apply a validation on the KNN algorithm to find a suitable K and P, where P results in a different definition of distance in the hypothesis set K = [0.5\%, 1\%, 2\%] cross P = [1, 1.5, 1.8, 2]. We also consider different data type, including raw data, standardization, and normalization. The problem we face is that KNN is too time-consuming, so we cannot test more K and P. And for different K and P, their performance didn't differ a lot.

(TS are the data adding "Team", "Season",and "TeamSeason" boolean extension columns without using Ratio\&Diff.) \\
(Ratio\&Diff are the data adding Team boolean extension columns.) \\
(Note that \_f represents the data with those boolean extension columns.)
