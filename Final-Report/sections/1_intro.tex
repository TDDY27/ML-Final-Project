\section{Introduction}
\ \par This final project is aim to use machine learning to predict HTMLB outcome. We have explore through many algorithms and data preprocess, and result in 0.58989 accuracy in predicting same season outcome(stage1) and 0.55473 in predicting a whole new season(stage2). We are going to break it down what have we done with every model and preprocess and what are the results.
